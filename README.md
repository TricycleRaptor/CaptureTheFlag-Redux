# CaptureTheFlag-Redux
An overhaul of the existing gamemode, Capture the Flag, by Nefusadi for Garry's Mod.

This project is intended to improve the vanilla gamemode and add features such as a class system for players,
a money feature, and an ordnance menu for use with said money system to purchase armor, vehicles, and other upgrades.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PLANNED FEATURES: ##

1.) Disable the spawn and context menu after the round starts. [COMPLETE]

2.) Show team-colored halo on players and vehicles only when under the crosshair. [COMPLETE]

3.) Disable PAC3 from the gamemode since outfits are no longer needed, and it is incompatible with halos. [COMPLETE]

4.) A round timer configurable via console that can determine a winner or put the game into overtime.

5.) A class menu for player loadouts, in order to eliminate the need for Weapon STAR. [COMPLETE]

6.) An ordnance menu so vehicles and other useful entities like ammo may be spawned mid-match. [IN PROGRESS]

7.) A money system for purchasing entities from said ordnance menu. [COMPLETE]

8.) Optional attachment progression via ordnance menu for CW2.0 weaponry. [COMPLETE]

9.) Implement prop and vehicle limit for each team.

10.) Add a condition to prevent the ordnance menu from being opened outside of base.

All credit for the original gamemode goes to Nefusadi. This project simply aims to build upon what they have already created.

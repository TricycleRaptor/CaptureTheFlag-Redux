# CaptureTheFlag-Redux
An overhaul of the existing gamemode, Capture the Flag, by Nefusadi for Garry's Mod.

This project is intended to improve the vanilla gamemode and add features such as a class system for players,
a money feature, and an ordnance menu for use with said money system to purchase armor, vehicles, and other upgrades.

The original gamemode can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=738284170

All credit for the original gamemode goes to Nefusadi. This project simply aims to build upon the base they have already
established with their work.

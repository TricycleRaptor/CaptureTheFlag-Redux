# CaptureTheFlag-Redux
An overhaul of the Capture the Flag gamemode for Garry's Mod by Nefusadi.

This project is intended to improve the vanilla gamemode and add features such as a class system for players,
a money feature, and an ordnance menu for use with said money system to purchase armor, vehicles, and other upgrades.
